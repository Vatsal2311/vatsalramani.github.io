As a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I supported undergraduate students in mastering embedded systems concepts and C programming fundamentals.<br/><br/>

- Designed and conducted lab sessions for 30+ undergraduate students on C programming for embedded systems using Arduino microcontrollers, covering GPIO, timers, interrupts, UART, and ADC to strengthen hands-on integration and embedded development skills.

- Collaborated with faculty to improve lab materials, grading rubrics, and instructional methods, ensuring alignment with industry-relevant embedded system practices, while providing individualized debugging and project support.
