- Developing an AI-powered framework to autonomously generate device bootloaders from scratch, enabling rapid firmware bring-up across diverse microcontroller architectures.
- Integrating LLM-based code synthesis with embedded toolchains to reduce manual bootloader development time by up to 70%, improving system initialization efficiency.
- Prototyping a self-validating bootloader pipeline where AI models write, compile, and test firmware, accelerating cross-platform hardware bring-up and validation.
