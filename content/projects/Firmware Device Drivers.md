Developed Linux-compatible **device drivers** for UART, SPI, I2C, and GPIO interfaces with **IRQ handling**, enabling real-time sensor communication and peripheral control. Implemented **mutex-based SPI driver** for flash and SD card read/write operations and utilized **FreeRTOS APIs** for multithreaded task synchronization.
